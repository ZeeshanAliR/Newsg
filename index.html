I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship, a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google, Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<h2>Books and Teaching</h2>
<ul>
    <li>In 2021 and 2022, Karen Levy and I taught a new course entitled Choices and Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.
        D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.
        <ul><li>This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks.</li>
         <li>The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites.</li>
         <li>Support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections.</li>
        <li>Kleinberg, E. Tardos. Algorithm Design.Addison Wesley, 2005.</li></ul>
<li>book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate algorithms course.
    An on-line course on edX entitled Networks, Crowds, and Markets, with David Easley and Eva Tardos.
